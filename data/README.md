* *daymet*: Not included, daily temperature min/max rasters for North America. Instructions on how to process these from downloaded netcdf's are in Process_gridded_temperature.R
* *eobs*: Not included, daily temperature min/max rasters for Europe. Instructions on how to process these from downloaded netcdf's are in Process_gridded_temperature.R
* *DDRP_results*: 2019 example from Europe included to show annual results (.tif) from DDRP. Analysis for 2010-2019 were used to make maps in the manuscript in 05_map_DDRP_results.R. These results come from analysis performed in 04_DDRP_phenology model.R.

**Experimental data**
